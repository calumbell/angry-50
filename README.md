# Angry 50

Project 6 of [CS50's Introduction to Games Development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/)

*Angry 50* is a game heavily inspired by Angry Birds and implemented in the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework. This assignment was all about working with the [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) physics engine that comes bundled with LÖVE2D.

## Requirements
*Legend of 50* was built using the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework (version 10.2).

[Push](https://github.com/Ulydev/push) was used for resolution-handling, [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/class.lua) was used for Lua object-orientation, and [Knife](https://github.com/airstruck/knife) was used to handle asynchronous code, chained functions, tweening, etc.
